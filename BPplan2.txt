	performance
	memory consumption
	renderLayers
	inputLayers
	message tree
string fstring(const char *fmt, ...)
renderlayers can call other renderlayers

list of GUI utils:
next/prev sibling;
world area; visible area;
calc offset/resulting rect to align/dock/stretch/crop
given part of rect1 with given part of rect2 (edges, corners, midpoints)
invalidate_up, invalidate_down, invalidate_tree
GUIroot element as the root of a given GUI tree.
area_desired - asks children before handing out new area.
but then invalidate can't change own area.
mouseover: 
	global (ignore all)
	visible parts of element
	frame (visible but not children)
	edges (NSWE)
	custom sub-area (title bar)
	as flags:
	visible, nochildren, edge_x, corner_x, midpoint_x, center
layout stuff:
	top-down:
		grid(min,max,weight) (desired = contents+extra*weight, final = clamp(desired,min,max))
		+grid.span	
		+tab/enter support
