/*
Horizon, HorizonRender, and HorizonOStools todo.

//1. [todo/optimization] make frameprinter and co use renderables instead of direct drawing,
	 so that we can remember the vertices used for text and re-use most of the rmodel.
	 \1.2. write a text shader so it can use a table of font metrics

//2. [todo] hide all globals behind singletons
//3. [todo] make renderscene actually exist
//4. [todo] try to remove "operators.h"
//5. [todo] rename eventListenerList to eventChannel so it's not just a typedef
//6. [todo] remove unused includes and lint stuff
//7. [todo] change include order so that stdlib/system includes always come first
