Models: 
	there are three types of model:
	model -	loaded from file, contains rmodel and texture
	rmodel - used by renderer
	e_model - used by model editor
	
	Loaded through model *m = getModel("box");

Textures:
	loaded through texture *t = getTexture("materials/brick");

Drawing:
	things are drawn on renderlayers; Layers are command buffers used for command ordering.
	A command written to a layer will be affected by all the commands and settings 
	that were already present on that layer. 

	Layers "2d" and "3d" are supplied by default and are cleared every frame.
	Other layers can be created using addLayer() after the selected layer.
	Those will not be auto-cleared.
	
	To draw things, data needs to be uploaded using uploadX() once. This includes rmodels and textures.
	After data is uploaded, it needs to be selected and drawn using selectX() and drawX().
	Data can be deleted using deleteX() to save space.

	If the drawn object looks strange or doesn't draw, the settings have probably changed.	

Camera:
	Camera defines the world-to-screen mapping. Not that it's state outside of a global render call is undefined.



Make a shape:
	create an edit model (e_model)
	create new vertices and triangles, specifying that model
	create a selection from e_model::selectAll()
	convert to rmodel by e_selection::rebuildRmodel()
